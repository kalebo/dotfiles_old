# Dotfiles for kalebo

## About
After using a few different dotfile managers I finally settled on using a simple git repo. This setup is inspired by StreakyCobra on HN. Nicola Paolucci then did a nice write up on the method and put it here : [The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)

## Setup
A setup gist is found [here](https://gist.github.com/kalebo/a4854c441b084d144c32e50b99e6cd68)
